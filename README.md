The Amazing Dice App
Thanks for choosing the Amazing Dice Rolling App! This app is sure to disappoint, so any mental anguish caused is entirely on the user.

Step 1 will ask for your name (or any name). It will only take letters & numbers, but letters have to come first - also NO SPACES. 

Examples of good names: someguy123 - someguy - Someguy123 - Someguy - SOMEGUY

Examples of bad names: 123someguy - some guy - some_guy - 1234567890 - Someguy@@ - !!someguy

In the next step you will be asked if you're ready to roll. 
Answering yes (y) continues the App to the 3rd step. 
Answering no (n) will prompt you with another message asking if you'd like to quit (q). Upon quitting you will recieve 
a heartfelt "Good bye!" and the program will end. But you won't do that; you're here to play dice! 

*Pressing any other key besides "q" will take you to step 3.* 

The 3rd step will prompt you to enter the number of sides for the first die. There is a very high limit on this number (over 2 billion). 
Failing to enter a number, a message will inform you that the input was incorrect. 
You will be asked to input a number again until a number is input.

The next part of step 3 will ask for your second dies' number of sides. The same parameters are used here.

Step 4: Finally the roll! At this step the application will randomly pick 2 numbers within the parameters of 
1 & the number of sides you picked, per die. You will get a prompt saying "Rolling..." followed by your randomly generated numbers. 
You will then be asked if you would like to continue rolling or quit. 
Re-rolling will return you to the first dies' sides selection and continue from there. 
Choosing no (n) will prompt you a final time if you'd like to quit (q). Choosing q will close the program. 

*Pressing any other key will return you to Step 3.*
